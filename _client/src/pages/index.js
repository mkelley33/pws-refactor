        <p>
          My name's Michaux Kelley. Iâ€™m a software developer, modern dude, natural-born-world-shaker, aspiring
          lepidopterist, philatelist, punk, writer, poet, and JavaScript hacker.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been in software development for about fifteen years now and have coded everything from full stack to
          more recently as a full-on front-end engineer. What can I say? I love to code!
